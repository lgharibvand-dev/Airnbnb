# LectureVault

LectureVault is a single-page website designed for selling and delivering downloadable lectures. It
lets students browse your catalog, purchase with PayPal or Stripe, and access downloads instantly
through interactive purchase modals.

## Features

- Responsive hero, lecture catalog, pricing, FAQ, and contact sections.
- Category filters for quickly narrowing down lectures.
- Purchase modals with PayPal button placeholders and Stripe checkout links.
- Download buttons that unlock after customers confirm payment.
- Accessible forms for contact and newsletter capture with inline validation feedback.

## Getting Started

1. Replace the placeholder download files in the `downloads/` folder with your real lecture assets
   or hosted URLs.
2. Swap the PayPal `hosted_button_id` values with IDs from your PayPal account.
3. Update the Stripe links to your Payment Links or Checkout Sessions.
4. Customize the lecture cards and pricing copy in `index.html` to match your catalog.

You can host the static files on any web server or deploy them to services such as GitHub Pages,
Netlify, or Vercel.
